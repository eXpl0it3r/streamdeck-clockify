## FAQ / Troubleshooting

- Why am I getting a yellow triangle when pressing the button?
  - Your API Key is likely incorrect
- Why am I not seeing the running timer on my button?
  - Make sure you haven't set a title, as this will override any other content
  - Make sure the API Key, Workspace name and optional the project and timer name 
- Why does the timer always start with a negative number?
  - This can happen when your local computer time isn't in sync with the Clockify server time
  - Make sure you synchronize your clock with a time server
- Why can't I select my Workspace and Project in a dropdown menu?
  - Because I was lazy ðŸ˜…
- IT DOESN'T WORK, WHY?!?
